# Yakkee
### A communication platform designed for seniors first. 

Yakkee is an open-source project where the mission is to build a communication platform designed seniors-first. It is a place for people to connect and spend time with friends old and new over video chat complete with games and other opportunities for interaction.
 
 In every possible way, this platform will be designed to learn how to work with its users instead of having its users learn how to work with the platform.
